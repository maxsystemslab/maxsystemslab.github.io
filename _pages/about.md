I'm a Tenure-Track Assistant Professor at Bellini College of AI, Cybersecurity, and Computing. 
I completed my doctoral degree from Rutgers University in New Brunswick, NJ, and a master's degree from Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, NJ, where I was advised by Prof. [Hang Liu](https://asherliu.github.io/). I received a Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Engineering from Tribhuvan University, Kathmandu, Nepal. During my PhD, I interned at Google, Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, and Brookhaven National Lab. 


My research interests lie at the intersection of systems and ML/HPC applications, focusing on full-circle innovation--using ML/HPC to design better systems (more current focus) and building optimized systems for ML/HPC applications. Notably, I have worked on developing accurate and reusable ML-based microarchitecture simulators while also accelerating and scaling these simulation models with hardware-software co-design, demonstrating the synergy between system optimization and ML/HPC.

My long-term focus is on automating the design and optimization of computing stacks (programs, compilers, and microarchitecture), leveraging generative models for design generation and deep learning models for performance modeling/optimization.

[ I am actively recruiting 2-3 highly motivated and dedicated PhD students to join my research group during the Fall 2025 and Spring 2026 cycle. These positions will be fully funded (tuition waiver + competitive stipend). My lab will focus on Machine Learning(ML)-driven computing systems, bridging high-performance computing, ML, and computer architecture. </b>
